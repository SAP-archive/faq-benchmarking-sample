Why is the platform slow?,
What are the standard languages?,"Our standard languages are Arabic, Catalan, Danish, Finnish, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norweigian, Dutch, Polish, Portugese, Russian, Swedish, and Chinese. If a language is standard that means that the bot has intent detection, custom entities, and language detection. "
How do I reset the memory of my bot?,"To reset the memory of your bot follow the steps below. 
1. From within a skill, click on ""Update Conversation"". 
2. Then select ""Edit Memory"" from the drop down menu. 
3. See a checkbox in the top left corner that says ""Reset all memory"" 
4. Select that box and click save and your memory will be reset when a user finishes that action block"
What is pronoun resolution?,"Pronoun resolution allows you to map pronouns to their entities in the conversation history. It is off my default. When you turn the feature on it will automatically replace users pronouns with the words they were referring to. 
For example: My HR manager is Mike. I would like to book an appointment with him. In this case, him would be resolved to Mike. "
How do I enable pronoun resolution? ,"From within your bot, click on the settings button on the top right. Go to the bottom of the page where it says ""NLP"". Navigate to the context management area and then click the box that says ""Resolve Pronouns"". "
How do I test my chatbot? ,"To test your chatbot navigate to the ""Chat with your bot"" bubble on the bottom right of your screen. From there, you can type in input as a user would and see the replies the bot would send. "
How do I delete my bot? ,"From within your bot, click on the settings button on the top right. Navigate to the ""Danger Zone"". Once in the danger zone select ""Delete bot"". "
How can I add a message delay?,"You can add a delay of up to 5 seconds between each message in a group of messages.

The main reason for adding a delay is so that users have enough time to read the message before your bot sends the next one. In a chat interface, this is especially important because each new message moves the previous message up. Also, dropping several messages with no delay can feel a little robotic! Another important reason for adding a delay is to give your bot personality. For example, you might want to add a short delay to make it look as though your bot is thinking! But be careful not to make your delays too long, so that users aren't waiting unnecessarily."
Is there a limit to the amount of characters in a message?,"On the platform, we display a character limit for every message. For example, a text message has a limit of 640 characters. This isn’t a real limitation; you can still create a text message with more characters. It serves as an indication based on what Facebook Messenger will accept. So if you're using Messenger, it's a good idea to observe the character limit; otherwise your messages won’t be posted in the user's conversation."
What message types do each of the channels support?,"For imformation on the message types that each channel supports, I would recemmond looking at the comparison grid on this page of the documentation https://cai.tools.sap/docs/concepts/channel"
How does the go-to skill work?,The go-to skill allows you to to connect two skills together. It skips triggers and automatically goes to the next skill. Please not that it does not skip requirements. 
Can you tell me about the go-to skill?,
How do I access my enviornment request token?,"Each environment has a dedicated request token. This means that if you want to analyze a text with the /request endpoint or use the Bot Builder API with the /dialog API, you can either provide a version token or an environment token.

If you provide an environment token in your request, it uses the version of your chatbot that is linked to this environment."
What is SAP Conversational AI? ,"SAP Conversational AI is a platform that allows you to build, train, connect, and monitor your intellegent chatbots.  "
What is an enviornment? ,"Environments are configurations applied to specific versions and help you to seamlessly deploy your chatbot in production. They are best leveraged as specific consumption environments, for example, Development, Staging, and Production. 
For more information on versioning and enviornments check out the further documentation here:https://cai.tools.sap/docs/concepts/versioning"
What should I know before starting my bot building process?,"Here are the first steps to understand the core concepts of the SAP Conversational AI platform. You'll then be able to build a chatbot that can manage an entire conversation with a user.

A chatbot is composed of two main elements: Skills and a training dataset.

A skill is a block of conversation that has a clear purpose and that your bot can execute to achieve a goal. You need to configure these skills to build the scope of your bot.

A training dataset is composed of many sentences organized into intents that represent what users say to your chatbot. The training dataset is used to train the bot to understand the user's needs and to trigger the right piece of conversation, reply correctly, and have a smooth conversation.
"
What predefined skills can I use for my bot?,"You can choose one or several predefined skills to use as a starting point for your chatbot. You're free to modify them if you don't like them as such, or even delete them once you're ready to make your own.

Here is the starter pack that contains a greeting, small talk, weather, customer satisfaction, and set alarm skill https://cai.tools.sap/scaffolder/starter-skills/train/intents"
What are the components of my skill?,"A skill is made of three distinct parts:

triggers: conditions determining if the skill should or shouldn't be activated
requirements: determining the information the bot needs to retrieve from the user, and how to retrieve it
actions: performed by the bot when all requirements are complete (for example, send a message)"
Can you tell me about the fallback skill?,A fallback skill is triggered if there is nothing else is triggered. You may only have one fallback skill per builder. 
How does my bot understand the text of a user? ,Bots use Natural Language Processing or NLP to understand the user utterances and map them to intents and entities that allow you to build a conversation flow. 
What parameters do you need for /request APIs? ,"All your requests must contain a header called Authorization, with a value of this form: Token DEVELOPER_TOKEN.  We encourage you to use request token on nothing else but your client side. Your developer token must only be used on the server side to manage your bots."
Which authentication methods for webhooks?,We support Oauth and Basic Auth 
Can you list the 28 gold entities?,"We have 28 gold entities. Here is the list of our gold entities: Cardinal, Color, Datetime, Distance, Duration, Email, Emoji, ip, Languague, Number, Ordinal, Organization, Phone, Pronoun, Percent, Person, Set, Sort, Speed, Temperature, URL, and Volume"
How can I add behaviors to the webchat?,"If you want to customize the style or add new functionalities that don't exist in the default hosted version, you can fork the open-source version on GitHub at SAPConversationalAI/Webchat.
"
Can I filter by version in the monitor tab?,"On the Monitor tab, you can filter all of the metrics by environment and version. For example, you can opt to see only the log feed for the STAGING environment or only the usage metrics for the PRODUCTION environment.
"
How do I create a version?,"By default, your bot has only one main version v1. 
You can create a new version under VERSION SETTINGS or in the dropdown near the bot name. 
Click CREATE NEW VERSION and select the version you want to copy. 
This copies the Train and Build tabs of the source version and creates a new version that you can then name. The new version is a pure copy; you can update the new version or the old one separately."
Can I have different versions of the same bot?,"A version is a package of your bot training dataset and skills. Each version is independent of the others and can be managed individually. For example, you might want to create a new version prior to major updates to your training dataset or skills. Additionally, separate versions may be useful if you want to leverage two variations of the same core bot.
"
How do I transfer ownership of my bot?,"To transfer an existing bot, go to the Settings page for the bot. Under Danger Zone, you can can then transfer the bot to one of your organizations."
What is an organization? ,"Organizations are shared accounts, allowing groups of people to collaborate on many bots at the same time. Administrators manage member access to an organization's bots.
"
How do I collaborate on a bot? ,
How do I create an organization?,"Anyone can create an organization. Navigate to your profile and select the ""+"" sign under your profile picture. Your organization can be private or public. For more information go here https://cai.tools.sap/docs/concepts/organization-account
"
"What is the difference between non personal data, personal data, and sensetive personal data?","Non personal data is data that is not related to your users or anyone. Personal data is data that could possibly identify a user or people that are related to your users (includes gender race and geographic location). Sensetive personal data is name, address, social secuirty number, phone number, email address, and any other data that can identify a user. "
What is a requirement?,"Requirements are either intents or entities that your skill needs to retrieve before executing actions. Requirements are pieces of information that are important in the conversation and that your bot can use, for example, the user's name or a location.

Once a requirement is completed, the associated value is stored in the bot's memory for the entire conversation."
What is a fallback channel? ,A fallback channel allows you to redirect your conversation to a human. We have an Intercom and a SAP Customer Engagaement Center Fallback Channel. 
How different do my intents need to be? ,"Train your bot with diversified expressions. In the following example, note how the expressions are structured differently. They try to anticipate the different ways that your user might ask for something. If all the expressions were structured the same way, for example, I'd like pizza, I'd like burger ‚ I'd like salad, your bot will have less success understanding the user."
What is a trigger? ,"
Triggers are conditions that determine whether the bot should execute the current skill or not. It can be an intent that is identified from user's statement, an entity or a property of the conversation.

If the trigger conditions of the skill are validated, the bot will execute it over other skills.

If a skill has no triggers, it will never be executed by a user input, but only if it is at the end of a redirection by another skill."
How many examples should I have per intent?,An intent should contain at least 30 expressions.
When should I use a floating and a business skill?,There is no execution difference between business and floating skills. The only thing that changes is the color to help you navigate through your flow.
Can I do user authentication? ,"This user authentication concept is only available if you're using the Bot Builder API directly (not through the Bot Connector), for example, through your dedicated webchat in your website. If you know that your user is logged in to your website, this authentication concept lets you use a token, cookie session, or user ID to authenticate the webhook call in  SAP Conversational AI."
Can I import data from other platforms? ,"We allow you to import data to the platform to help you speed up your bot development process using our import function. To keep the training effort low and make it easier for you to move to our platform you can import intents, expressions, and your own custom entities. Currently, we support both: CSV and JSON format for importing your NLP data.
"
What are the payloads I can use for buttons?,"In the following payloads, buttons can either be:

postback: the basic type, once the button is tapped, the value is sent as a normal incoming message
web_url: depending on the channel, once this button is tapped, the URL in the value field is loaded
phone_number: depending on the channel, once this button is tapped, the phone number in the value field will be called"
How do I send rich messages? ,"To send a message, you need to make a post request with your bot's Request Token available in your bot settings and send specific payload for each message type.
"
What are the variables I can use in my replies? ,"You can create all of the following variables:

{{conversation_id}}: ID of the current conversation.
{{participant_data}}: An object filled with participant information that is provided by the channel connected through the Bot Connector. By default, you always have a username. You can easily use {{participant_data.username}}.
{{memory}}: The complete memory object. You can access each element like {{memory.person.raw}}. Here, person is the alias of a requirement.
{{skill_occurences}}: Number of consecutive occurrences of the current skill.
{{language}}: Language ISO code of the current conversation.
{{current_message}}: The message source sent by the user.
{{#entity}}: An alias of the nlp.entities object. You can access each element like {{#entity.confidence}} where confidence is nlp.entities.confidence.
{{message_received_at}}: Timestamp of when the message was received.
{{nlp}}: The full nlp object. You can access any property of it like {{nlp.sentiment}} for example if you want to get the sentiment property."
Why does my message look different on one channel versus another?,"If your bot is connected to a channel through the Bot Connector, these messages types are adapted to the channel constraint and transformed, so the look and feel will probably change compared with what you see on the SAP Conversational AI platform.
"
What type of messages can you send on the platform?,"Many different formats are supported, enabling you to build an awesome user experience for your bots. For example, text, card, buttons, quick replies, carousel, lists, and images. "
Can you start a conversation with memory?,"You can start a conversation with prefilled information in the memory, and not wait until the first user input is analyzed and the first skills are triggered. However, this is only possible if you are using the Bot Builder directly (without the Bot Connector). To understand how to use the Bot Builder API to do this, see /Dialog (Text) in the API Reference.

If you‚ are using Webchat, you can easily start a conversation by sending information in the memory. For more information, see Bot memory management."
How do I manipulate memory in the platform?,The memory can be filled automatically through the requirements or manually through a configuration of an edit memory action.
How does conversation memory work? ,"Each conversation with a unique user has a memory object from the beginning to the end of the conversation. This memory persists during the entire conversation; you can update it at any time or clear it whenever you want.

When a new conversation starts, the memory is an empty object (unless you want to start a new conversation with prefilled keys). The memory is stored in your conversation state. It is returned in the default body of a webhook and after the Bot Builder API call."
What channels can I connect my chatbot to?,"Here are the channels that are supported by the platform. Custom webchat as a channel, Callr, Cisco Webex Teams, kik, LINE, Facebook Messenger, Skype, Slack, SAP Jam, Telegram, Twilo, Twitch, Twitter, Amazon Alexa, or SAP CoPilot.  "
Can I connect my bot to SAP Jam? ,
Can I connect my bot to Alexa? ,
Can I connect my bot to Whatsapp? ,
How do I call a webhook?,"To call a webhook you can provide the full URL or route (starting with a '/') to be called by the Bot Builder. If you provide a route, the Bot webhook base URL (configurable in your bot's settings) will be prepended to it.

You can specify the HTTP method to use in your webhook call (GET, POST, PUT, or PATCH)."
What is a webhook?,"At many points in your conversation, you most likely want to retrieve business information or connect to an external system to perform actions. You can do this through webhooks. A webhook is a simple HTTP call to your backend. To configure your HTTP call, click CALL WEBHOOK in the Bot Builder.
"
How do I use memory for my conversation? ,Check out this article on how to use memory in your conversation flow https://cai.tools.sap/blog/mastering-memory-management-bot-builder/
What is a condition?,"A condition is a test that can be evaluated to either true or false.

You can find conditions in different sections of your skill:

in the triggers
in the requirements
in each group of actions."
In which languages can I build a bot?  ,The platform will work in any language. We have some languages that have advanced and standard features. 
What are the advanced languages? ,"Our advanced languages have some additional support compared to our standard languages. Specifically, the advanced languages have gold entities automatically tagged, sentiment detection for each user utterance, and act and type detection. If a language is standard that means that the bot has intent detection, custom entities, and language detection.  
"
What would I use the build tab for? ,"You can use the build tab to create your conversation flow. README.md: Where you explain the purpose of the skill.

Triggers: Where you define why this skill should be activated after a user message.

Requirements: What information this skill has to collect, and what questions need to be asked to fulfill the requirements.

Actions: What to do once the requirements are fulfilled."
How do I create a restrictred custom entity?,"To create a restricted custom entity: In SAP Conversational AI go to Entities, click CREATE, and select Restricted entity. Then add values (synonyms) for this entity. You can also upload a CSV file or use the gazette endpoint of the API to quickly create a large list of synonyms."
What is the difference between restricted custom entities and free custom entities? ,"Free custom entities are used when you don't have a strict list. For example, you want your bot to detect book titles. Restricted Entities are used when you have a closed list. For example, a list of possible orders from a menu. "
What is a gold entity? ," Entities that are already created and pre-trained are referred as Gold entities. They are detected automatically for our advanced languages. To bring you a precise service with true added value, we enrich each gold entity with essential core information. For example, when the gold entity `tomorrow` is detected in a sentence, a formatted version of the datetime that you can use as a reply is returned. You are not able to deactivate or train them. "
How do the gold entities work?,
Tell me about gold entities,
What is an entity? ,"An entity is a keyword that is extracted from an expression. We automatically detect 28 different entities such as Datetime, Location, Person, and so on. We call them gold entities. However, you're not limited to these gold entities. You can also tag your own custom entities to detect keywords depending on your bot's context, such as subway stations if you're building a transport assistant."
Can you give me an example of intents? ,"Here are some example intents for when someone asks for help. Just create an intent called `help` and fill it with every expression a user would say when asking for guidance.

Could you help me?
I am lost, give me a hand please.
Can you help?
What can you do for me?"
How would you recemmond structuring an intent? ,"Make sure your intents are distinct enough to avoid misunderstandings and unnecessary confusion
Balance your intents: try to have the same amount of expressions in each of them
Diversify your intents: use as many different grammatical structures as you can"
How do I build a chatbot? ,"Click + New Bot at the top right of the page 

1) Enter a name and a description 

2) Add up to six topics to your bot 

3) Set the default language. You can add more languages later.

4) Select the appropriate Data Policy

5) Specify whether your bot is public or private.

6) Click CREATE A BOT.

For a tutorial check out this blog post [here](https://cai.tools.sap/blog/build-your-first-bot-with-sap-conversational-ai/)"
How do I build a bot?,
What is an intent? ,An intent is a box of expressions that mean the same thing but are constructed in different ways. Intents are the heart of your bot's understanding. Each one of your intents represents an idea your bot is able to understand.
What is a skill?,"A skill is a block of conversations that has a clear purpose and that your bot can execute to achieve a goal. It can be as simple as the ability to greet someone, but it can also be more complex, like giving a movie suggestion based on information provided by the user."
