If the trigger conditions of the skill are validated, the bot will execute it over other skills. If a skill has no triggers, it will never be executed by a user input, but only if it is at the end of a redirection by another skill."

Is it possible to add a delay between messages?,"You can add a delay of up to 5 seconds between each message in a group of messages. The main reason for adding a delay is so that users have enough time to read the message before your bot sends the next one. In a chat interface, this is especially important because each new message moves the previous message up. Also, dropping several messages with no delay can feel a little … robotic! Another important reason for adding a delay is to give your bot personality. For example, you might want to add a short delay to make it look as though your bot is thinking! But be careful not to make your delays too long, so that users aren’t waiting unnecessarily."
